#### Pillball ###

Pillball is an open source project written in Node.js and built with two people in mind - Those who frequently forget to take their medication, and beginners in the Open Source Community who have previously found it difficult to contribute to any project due to the learning curve of many projects that they wish to help with.

Pillball aims to provide a simple emailing service for those who wish to receive them, emailing simple reminders to take medication to its users at specified times, while providing an excellent source of feature-requests and fixes for beginners within the open source community.

We also completely support and encourage the addition of community submitted features, so if you want to stretch those coding muscles, feel free to submit your idea and we will endevour to accept it.
