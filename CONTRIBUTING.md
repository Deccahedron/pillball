## Contributing to Pillball ##

Contributing to Pillball is easy, and we have some simple guidelines that tries to fit to a standard that you might expect when developing for much larger Repositories in the 'Real World'. So please read these carefully and don't be afraid to make mistakes! 

Also please make sure you take the time to read our Code of Conduct! 


## Where to Begin ##
1. Make sure you have a GitHub account.
2. First, check and confirm that the feature you wish to implement, or the issue that you wish to resolve doesn't already have a ticket. Submit a ticket for your issue or new feature, if not!
3. Clearly describe the issue as well as any steps that need to be taken to reproduce the bug. Screenshots are nice, but are not required. Ensure that you include the version number that seems to be causing the issue, and then go ahead and Fork the repository using your Github account.

## Branch Guidelines ##
Once Forked, you're going to want to create a branch based on the branch that requires work.

to work on a branch based on master, you can use: git checkout -b issues/issue-#[issue number]/[Your Github username]. 

Commit often with helpful commit messages. Use git diff --check before committing, as this will remove any unnecessary whitespace.

## Submitting Your Changes ##

1. Push all your code into your working branch in your repository and then submit a pull request to the main Project Repository. (Look here on how to do this: TODO: add link)

2. Return to the original issue page and add a message with the link to the Pull Request.


## Reviewing your Changes ##

Before your changes are accepted, they will be subject to some friendly peer review and testing. Your changes will now either be Accepted or Rejected. 

## Accepted Changes ##

CONGRATULATIONS! Your changes were accepted and as such were merged into the master branch. Feel free to tackle another issue!

## Rejected Changes ## 

Don't be disheartened! You will be given a detailed explanation on why your changes were rejected, and how your work can be improved upon. Keep at it, listen to the advice and suggestions and try again, as many times as you need!
